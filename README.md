Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. In addition to continuing the script work, I also focused on the OnlineHelp knowledge transfer with Tawheed and Philip. Thanks to Tawheed for the detailed explanations and for answering all my questions. I also completed a few Pega ZIP deployments before logging off.

As for today, I have a few meetings to attend, and I’ll also spend some time reviewing the OnlineHelp wiki and providing feedback to help improve it if I get the chance. That’s my plan for today.
