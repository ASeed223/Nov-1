Good morning everyone, yesterday morning I mainly focused on the OCP sprint review meeting. After that, I troubleshooted the issue with the EDR2 repo’s IQ scan pipeline and closed out the task on my board. I also spent some time completing the GenAI training and created a task to request access to Colipot.
As for today, I have a few meetings to attend, and I will continue working on the tasks on my board. That’s my plan for today.
