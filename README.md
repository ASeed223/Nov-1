Good morning everyone, yesterday after the morning meeting, I completed a 26.1 branch request for the Analytic Model Services. Then I attended the TKT meeting. In the afternoon, I met with Jake, Philip, and Riley to go over Philip’s PBI, and also followed along to set up encrypted secrets with SOPS on lxadm101.

As for today, I’ll continue working on the tasks on my board and attend the few other meetings. That’s my plan for today.
