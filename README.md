Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, aside from meetings, I mainly focused on the IQ server monthly maintenance task. I attempted to upgrade the IQ server to the latest version, but the automated upgrade was unsuccessful due to a configuration file issue. As a result, I rolled back to the current version and will need to spend some time updating the configuration files before retrying the upgrade.

Other than that, I completed the online help deployment with Tawheed and set up the deploy pipeline for  the major release.

As for today, I have a couple of meetings to attend and will continue focusing on the tasks on my board. That’s the plan for today.
