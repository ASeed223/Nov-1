Thanks for the help, Jay. I was researching the setup, and your reply really saved me some time.

I found the settings you mentioned, but it looks like nx-usertoken-current might be a better fit for them? Its description says it gives "All permissions for Current User Token," which would allow developers to view, generate, and reset their own tokens.

On the other hand, nx-usertoken-users is described as "Reset permission for all User Tokens," and I'm not sure if that actually allows them to generate their own. Should I go with nx-usertoken-current instead to make sure they can manage their own keys?
