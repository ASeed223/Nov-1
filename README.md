Hi Tawheed, would it be possible to add the servers involved in the Ansible tasks to the Online Help wiki? For example, in the onlineHelpDeploy.yml, the unzip task uses the lxnp102 server.

Also, could you include the shared folder path that you showed us during today’s meeting?

I believe having this information documented in the wiki will be very helpful for us in future troubleshooting and maintenance.

Thanks!
