Hi everyone, this is Shushen. I joined the team a little over a year ago, so I still feel relatively new compared to some of the other team members. In the CM team, I mainly focus on tasks related to Nexus, the IQ server, and some Azure Pipelines that support the security team with their weekly scans.

I’m also part of the OCP team, and I can share more about that later. If you’re interested in learning about any of these areas, feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to share what I know.
