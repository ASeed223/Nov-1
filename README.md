Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday after the morning meeting, I mainly focused on adding an API health check to the Ansible playbook used to start up the servers for the infrastructure maintenance release. The coding part is almost done, and I will test the script to make sure everything works as expected so Chris can use the playbook on Friday night. As for today, I will attend the TKT meeting and continue testing the script. That’s my plan for today.
