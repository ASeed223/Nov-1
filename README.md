Hi Neo,

I noticed that you will be out of the office tomorrow, so I wanted to check with you in advance. Would it be okay if I take next Monday off to recover from this week’s on-call duty?

There have been quite a few things going on for this week's on call, and both Cathy and I have been working pretty late every day to keep things moving. I just wanted to see if taking Monday off would be acceptable.

Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!


Time Off Request for Next Monday
