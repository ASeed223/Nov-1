Hi Philip and Dylan,

If you’re planning to send out the on-call email next week using the email I sent this week as a template, please remove the following email address from the distribution list.

The mailbox was included because the list was copied from a previous on-call email, and it should not be part of the on-call notifications.

Thank you.
