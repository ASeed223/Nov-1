Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, I mainly attended meetings, and for the rest of the time, I completed a few Pega ZIP deployments and continued coding the new IQ scan pipeline for the EDR1 repos. I should be able to finish the coding today, and I can start testing these new pipelines next week. I’ll also look for any other tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for today.
