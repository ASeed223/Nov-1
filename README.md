Good morning everyone,
Last Friday, besides completing a few Pega zip deployments to DEV3 and TST3, I also finished coding the new IQ scan pipeline for the EDR1 repos. I’ll spend some time testing it out today.

As for today, I’ll be attending the OCP meeting with Philip and Riley to go over Philip’s PBI. I’ll also be the on-call person today, since Jay covered my previous on-call shift last month. I’ll also pick up or assist with any other tasks where I can help.

That’s my plan for today.
