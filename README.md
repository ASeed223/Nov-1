Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday morning, I mainly attended the online help deployment meeting and the orchestration meeting. Other than that, I picked up the few Pega ZIP deployment tasks and the online help deployment task—thanks to Tawheed for keeping an eye on and making sure I did everything correctly.
As for today, I will continue working on my new Ansible playbook and hopefully make some progress. I will also look for any other tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for today.
