Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, after returning from my appointment, I found out that my jumpbox was down and I wasn’t able to access it. I spent a couple of hours contacting the IT service desk, and I’m still waiting for them to send someone to check my jumpbox and bring it back online. Besides that, I continued working on the scan pipeline and completed a few Pega ZIP deployments to TST3 and DEV3 before logging off. As for today, I have a couple of meetings to attend and will continue focusing on the tasks on my board. That’s my plan for the day.
