Good morning everyone, just a quick update for me. Yesterday morning was mainly meetings and shadowing with Philip and Riley on the DEV3/TST3 OCP upgrade to 25.4.3. For the rest of the day, I helped the security team remove the duplicated IQ scan pipelines and clean up the duplicated reports inside the IQ server. After that, I continued troubleshooting the Nexus task issue — tried a couple of methods, but still couldn’t fix the issue. I plan to spend about half a day on that today, and if I still can’t resolve it, I might reach out to you, Brandon, to discuss next steps. For today, I’ll be attending the TKT meeting and continuing to work on the tasks on my board. That’s my plan for today.
