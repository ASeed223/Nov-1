Hi, the branches have been recreated. In the future, can you please also include the branches that the new branches based on so we can aviod this happen again. I also know that your colleage made a PR merge into the develop/25.4.5.1 yesterday and can you let him know so he can merge his change into the develop branch again? Thank you.
