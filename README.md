Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, besides attending meetings, I shadowed Shelly and helped her set up KeePass. I also walked her through the step-by-step procedures for deploying Pega ZIPs to TST3 and DEV3, and replied to related emails after the deployments were completed.

Later in the evening, I focused on the TST1A and TST1B deployments, and Shelly was able to kick off the OCP Codestream 1 pipeline.

As for today, it will be pretty much the same. I’ll try to pick up or assist with any other tasks where I can help and continue focusing on my on-call duties tonight. That’s my plan for the day.
