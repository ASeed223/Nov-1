Hi David, for the EDR-AppDev-NonJava project, is there a specific folder you’d like me to scan? Scanning the entire EDR-AppDev-NonJava repo would take quite a bit of time, and the Azure agent we set up in TFS has a time limit. If the pipeline runs for more than 60 minutes, the operation will be automatically canceled. If you do want to scan the entire repository, I can create a separate pipeline for it. What do you think?
