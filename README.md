run a specific sequence of repair tasks that together achieve the same result. First, the “Repair – Recalculate blob store storage” task forces Nexus to rescan the blob store and rebuild any missing .properties or metadata cache entries. Next, the “Repair – Reconcile component database from blob store” task correctly re-synchronizes the database with the blob store. After that, running “Repair – Rebuild repository browse” reconstructs the Browse tree in the UI so all components become visible again. Finally, the “Repair – Rebuild Maven repository metadata (maven-metadata.xml)” task regenerates the actual metadata files for each group and artifact.
