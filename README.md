Good evening, TST1A deployment is complete and is ready for testing. However bpm_app_5\26.01.0106_SAF.zip (And none of the SAF got imported )imported tonight. Because the CO for the DBCR wasn't transitioned to Dev Complete until this afternoon, so the DBCR missed today's build. The bpm_app_5\26.01.0106_SAF.zip will import it tomorrow.
