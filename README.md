Good morning everyone. Yesterday, besides the TKT meeting, I mainly focused on upgrading the Nexus HA to a newer version. Since we haven’t done an upgrade for about a year, the configuration files in the new version look very different, so I spent a lot of time figuring them out. After I finished reviewing the files, the service failed to start due to an SSL-related issue. I’ll spend more time troubleshooting that today. That’s my plan for the day.
