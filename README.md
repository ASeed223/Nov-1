Good morning everyone, last Friday I mainly spent the day working on the Nexus HA upgrade. I was able to fix the SSL issue and bring Nexus HA back online. However, after the upgrade, the alias used to check the server status was no longer working, which caused the Ansible playbook to error out, so I created a separate task to investigate this issue. Other than that, I also completed a few Pega ZIP deployments to tst3 and dev3 before logging off. As for today, I will focus on the Nexus-related tasks that I own. That’s my plan for the day.
