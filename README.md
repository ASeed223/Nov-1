Good morning everyone. Yesterday, besides meetings, I spent some time reviewing the Online Help wiki and shared my feedback with Tawheed to help improve it. I also finished coding the new IQ scan pipeline and will be testing it out today. Also, I completed a few Pega ZIP deployments before logging off.
For today, it’s pretty much the same plan—I have a couple of meetings to attend and will continue focusing on the tasks on my board.That's my plan for today.
