Good morning everyone,
Yesterday after the morning meeting, I spent some time updating the IQ Server monthly maintenance wiki and included the steps for using the Ansible playbook to perform the upgrade. I also closed out a few tasks that had been on the board for a while and completed several Pega deployments before logging off.

As for today, I have the OCP sprint planning and the Sonatype support meeting to attend this morning. That’s my plan for today.
