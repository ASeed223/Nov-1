Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, after the morning meeting, I mainly focused on my script work, then shadowed Brandon, Tawheed, and Riley on the OpenShift build template YAML for the CS3 deployment. I also picked up a Pega ZIP deployment to TST3 and DEV3 as usual.

As for today, it’s pretty much the same. I’ll continue working on my script and will shadow Tawheed and Philip again for the online help knowledge transfer. That’s my plan for today.
