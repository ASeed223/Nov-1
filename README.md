Since IQ Server does not support scanning .hts files and they are not used for component or vulnerability detection, the pipeline error occurs when the scanner attempts to process them. To resolve this issue, we will update the pipeline configuration to exclude .hts files by adding !**/*.hts to the scanTargets list, ensuring these unsupported files are skipped during the scan and preventing the pipeline from failing.
