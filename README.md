Good morning everyone, yesterday besides working on the Pega deployments to TST3 and DEV3, I also spent some time helping create the new EDR Document Builder repo. Later in the afternoon, I helped one of the FTB staff members by providing some potential solutions to resolve an issue they were having with cloning a repo, and I also followed up on a request regarding their team not receiving the email notifications for the Codestream 2 deployment.

As for today, I will continue working on the tasks on my board and attend a few other meetings. That’s my plan for today.
