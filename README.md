Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, in addition to working on a few Pega ZIP deployments, I mainly prepared for my OCP on-call duties. I wasn’t aware that I was on call this week until I was assigned a task, so I spent some time reviewing OCP-related materials and preparing for the ConfigMap update task that was assigned to me. Also thanks for Tawheed for checking the commands that I will be running for me. As for today, I will start applying the changes once the prerequisite tasks are completed, and I will continue to pick up or assist with any other tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for today.
