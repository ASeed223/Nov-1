Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, I mainly focused on testing the new changes I implemented in the Ansible playbook that starts up the servers, and the output looks good to me. In addition, I worked on granting staff access to Nexus and closed out a few other tasks on my board.As for today, I have several meetings to attend, and I will start working on a new playbook to automate the Nexus HA upgrade for future use. That’s my plan for the day.
