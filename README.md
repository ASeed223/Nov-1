Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me.
Yesterday, besides attending a few meetings, I completed the Online Help deployment with Tawheed. Later that night, I shadowed Shelly and demonstrated how to work on the Invariant POR, Pega POR, and AnalyticModels POR, including how to run the OCP Codestream 1 pipeline. We also went over the overall on-call procedures. In addition, I completed the TST1A and TST1B deployments and released the environments.

As for today, it will be pretty much the same. I will mainly focus on meetings and continue my on-call duty tonight. That’s my plan for today.
