Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out.

For Sonatype Nexus, my responsibility is focused on the application layer — specifically the upgrade, maintenance, and ensuring that the Nexus service continues to operate properly. The underlying Linux server configuration, storage, and infrastructure resources are managed by a different team.

Based on the Phase definitions in the spreadsheet, Nexus would fall under:

Phase II – NTD (New Technology Deployment)
This aligns with the upgrade activities, version refresh, configuration updates, and validation work that I handle during Nexus/IQ Server upgrades.

Phase III – Operations
This covers the ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and ensuring the Nexus service remains healthy after deployment.

Please feel free to update the Master copy accordingly.
If there is anything more needed from my side, let me know.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
