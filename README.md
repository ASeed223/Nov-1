Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me. Yesterday, besides attending the TKT meeting, I finally fixed the Nexus task execution failure. I’ve included all the details and procedures in the task description, explaining how I used the Nexus UI feature to troubleshoot the issue. Other than that, I helped import a few Pega ZIPs to TST3 and DEV3.

For today, I’ll be working on some wiki updates and looking for any tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for today.
