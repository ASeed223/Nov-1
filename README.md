Good morning everyone.
Yesterday, besides attending meetings, I focused on the IQ scan pipeline task for several EDR2 repositories. While testing the script, I ran into an issue where a file name contained a Unicode dash character, which caused the pipeline to fail. I created a separate task to investigate this error further.

For today, I’ll continue working on that investigation and also look for any additional tasks where I can contribute.
