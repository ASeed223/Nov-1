Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, beside working on few Pega ZIP deployments, I spent most of the day updating the ConfigMap for the TPF UI in the CS1 and CS2 environments. It took longer than expected because when they containerized the repositories in CS2,  several files that were misconfigured and I had to fix them one by one. Overall, I was able to resolve all the issues and close out the task. Also, Thanks to Tawheed for the help yesterday. As for today, I will continue my OCP on-call duties and pick up or assist with any tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for today.
