Hi Chris,

I’m not sure if you currently have access, but I was able to log in to Workspace using my MyFTB account via the link below:
https://workspace.ftb.ca.gov/SAAS/auth/login

From there, I was able to use Horizon to log into a Windows machine that is connected to the FTB network. Within that environment, you should also be able to remote connect to your jumpbox.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you run into any issues.
