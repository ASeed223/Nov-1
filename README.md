Hi [Name],

Thanks for the clarification regarding NTD.

Based on the definitions in the roadmap, the most appropriate Phase for Sonatype Nexus would be:

Phase III – Operations

My responsibilities primarily involve maintaining the Nexus/IQ application, performing upgrades, ensuring the service remains stable, and addressing operational issues. These activities fit most closely under the Operations phase.
