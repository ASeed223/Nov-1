Hi Tawheed,

Based on what Neo mentioned, Philip and I will be taking over the online help after you roll off next year. Would it be possible to schedule one or two meetings after the Thanksgiving break so we can go over more details regarding the online help?

For example, we’d like to review any tasks related to the online help, as well as learn some of the troubleshooting methods you’ve been using.

Thank you!
