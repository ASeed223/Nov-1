Only users assigned the "maven_developer" role have access to generate their own user tokens. If a team member cannot access the page, please create a task for the CM team to grant them access. All we need is their User ID. Note that FTB employees do not require approval, but vendors (SPs) must obtain approval from their supervisor.
