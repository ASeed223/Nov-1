Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, after I got back online around 11:00, I mainly replied to a few emails and followed up on a couple of tasks that needed my attention. Later in the afternoon, I followed up on the PrimeFaces component issue in IQ server, and the task requester was able to access the component after it was unquarantined. Other than that, I shadowed with Shelly during her UIT1 deployment and worked with her to follow up on the UIT1 SQL Pega database patch issue.
As for today, I will focus on the Online Help deployment and continue working on the tasks on my board. That’s my plan for the day.
