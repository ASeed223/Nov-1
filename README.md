Good evening,

The TST1A deployment is complete and ready for testing. However, bpm_app_5\26.01.0106_SAF.zip was not imported tonight (none of the SAFs were imported). This is because the CO for the DBCR was not transitioned to Dev Complete until this afternoon, so the DBCR missed today’s build. The bpm_app_5\26.01.0106_SAF.zip will be imported tomorrow.
