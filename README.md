Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, besides attending meetings, I mainly focused on cleaning up the mess in TST3. We ended up needing to do a database restore on TST3, and I redeployed all the Pega zips from Monday and Wednesday.

For today, I’ll spend some time working on the OCP pipeline update task that I picked up yesterday, and that’s my plan for today.
