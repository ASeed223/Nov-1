Good morning everyone, just a quick update from me.
Today, I’ll spend some time checking emails and responding to a few tasks that came up while I was out last week. Since I’m on call this week, I’ll also spend some time preparing and getting ready for tonight’s on-call duty. That’s my plan for today.
