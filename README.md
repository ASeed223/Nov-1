Hi Neo,

My vacation schedule will be from 12/29 to 1/2. Since 1/1 is a holiday, I will be taking 4 days off, totaling 32 hours.

I’d like to use my Professional Development Day and Personal Holiday first to cover 3 of those days, and then use 8 hours of Furlough time for the remaining day. Please let me know if this arrangement complies with the policy.

Thank you.
