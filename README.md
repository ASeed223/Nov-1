Good morning everyone,
Yesterday, besides meetings, I mainly focused on the two tasks I picked up. I was able to complete the 26.2 branch request task for 10 other repos, and I also worked on a vulnerability issue caused by an outdated plugin in lxnpaap01. I decided to postpone the plugin upgrade until next week to ensure today’s release goes smoothly. I don’t expect the issue to have an impact, but I wanted to be safe.

As for today, I will circle back to the IQ server tasks I was working on Wednesday and continue working on, or picking up, any other tasks where I can help. That’s my plan for the day.
