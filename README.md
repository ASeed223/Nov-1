Good morning everyone,
Last Friday, I mainly worked on the IQ Server monthly maintenance task. I was able to fix the configuration file issue and successfully use the Ansible playbook to upgrade the IQ Server to the latest version. I also updated the license threat groups to the newest as well.
As for today, I will continue working on my Ansible playbook for the Nexus upgrade and plan to test it in the Nexus HA environment. I’ll also try to pick up or assist with any other tasks where I can help.

That’s the plan for the day.
