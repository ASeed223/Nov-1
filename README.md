Good morning everyone. Last Friday, I mainly worked on my new Ansible playbook for the Nexus HA upgrade. So far, I’ve completed the automation to check whether the installation package we want to upgrade is present on the server, then automatically extract, rename, and archive the package.

Today, I will continue working on the hardest part, which is automatically replacing some values in the configuration files. That’s my plan for today.
